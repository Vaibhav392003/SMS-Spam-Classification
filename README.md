# SMS-Spam-Classification
This is project in Data Science for SMS Spam Classification. 

Our hate speech detection project leveraged powerful data science tools to combat harmful online language. 
Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas wrangled training data, preparing labeled text samples for analysis. 
Machine learning algorithms were trained on this data, meticulously fitting models to discern hateful content from regular speech.
Data visualization tools then illuminated patterns and biases, guiding refinement of the detection methods. By harnessing 
this data-driven approach, we aimed to build a shield against online hate, fostering a more inclusive and respectful online environment.
